# UC Berkeley Master's Program -- ARGO Buoy Capstone

This repository contains the code, presentations, and final report for a semester-long group project by Axel Amzallag, Joshua Hug, and Timothy Kalnins as part of STAT 222 (Masters of Statistics Capstone Project) at the University of California Berkeley. The goal of the project was to try and connect temperature levels in the Pacific Ocean to typhoon starting locations. The ocean data was collected from the ARGO project's buoy data provided by the University of California, San Diego: https://argo.ucsd.edu/. The typhoon data was from the United States Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center: https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html?western-pacific.
